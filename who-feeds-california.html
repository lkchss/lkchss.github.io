      <h1>Who Feeds California?</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">January 2026</p>

      <p>Growing up in Roseville, I didn't think much about the fields between Sacramento and the Bay Area. They were the backdrop of the drive &mdash; flat, enormous, punctuated by almond trees and the occasional hand-painted fruit stand. It wasn't until I started studying economics, and later working with agricultural data professionally, that I began to understand what I'd been driving past.</p>

      <p>California's Central Valley produces roughly a quarter of the nation's food on about one percent of its farmland. The scale is extraordinary, but the economics are precarious. The people who make it work &mdash; overwhelmingly immigrant families &mdash; operate on thin margins, seasonal uncertainty, and a labor market that the rest of the state prefers not to examine too closely.</p>

      <p>At the Federal Reserve, I built a dataset mapping outstanding farm credit loans across geographic regions. The exercise was technical &mdash; geocoding, spatial joins, aggregation across Federal Reserve banking markets &mdash; but the picture it revealed was not. Farm lending is concentrated in ways that mirror the vulnerability of the communities it serves. When a single lender pulls back or fails, entire regions feel it. When credit tightens, the effects ripple through families and towns that most Californians never think about.</p>

      <p>This isn't abstract for me. I'm from this part of California. The people growing the food that shows up in Bay Area restaurants and tech campus cafeterias are, in many cases, the same communities I grew up alongside. There is a disconnect between the sophistication of California's technology economy and its awareness of the agricultural system that literally feeds it.</p>

      <p>I think about this gap a lot. Climate change is already reshaping growing seasons, water availability, and pest patterns in the Central Valley. The next generation of agricultural tools &mdash; precision irrigation, soil monitoring, supply chain logistics &mdash; will be built by people in San Francisco and Seattle. Whether those tools actually serve the people farming the land depends entirely on whether the builders understand who those people are, what constraints they face, and how policy shapes their access to credit, water, and markets.</p>

      <p>At the venture capital firm where I worked before the Fed, I analyzed agricultural land investments in the Pacific Northwest. I built valuation models using county tax data, comparable sales, and regulatory constraints. The work was quantitative, but the most useful thing I learned wasn't a technique. It was that the distance between a spreadsheet and the reality it describes is enormous &mdash; and that distance grows when the people building the models have never been to the places the data comes from.</p>

      <p>The conversation about technology and agriculture tends to happen in two separate rooms. In one room, engineers and investors discuss precision ag, autonomous equipment, and climate-resilient crops. In the other, farmers, laborers, and rural communities deal with the actual consequences of water policy, credit access, and labor shortages. Very few people move between both rooms.</p>

      <p>That's the connection I keep coming back to: the gap between who builds the technology and who it's built for. Closing it doesn't require better engineering alone. It requires people who understand both sides &mdash; the data and the dirt.</p>
