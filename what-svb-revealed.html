      <h1>What a Bank Failure Revealed About Agriculture and Technology</h1>
      <p class="article-meta">February 2026</p>

      <p>In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. The immediate story was about startups and venture capital &mdash; tech companies scrambling to make payroll, VCs texting on Signal, a bank run accelerated by social media. It was framed, reasonably, as a technology industry crisis.</p>

      <p>But there was another story that got less attention. SVB had a significant agricultural lending practice, particularly in Northern California's wine country. When the bank failed, it wasn't just startup founders who lost access to their banking relationships &mdash; it was agricultural businesses that depended on SVB for operating lines of credit, seasonal financing, and the kind of specialized lending that commodity-dependent businesses require.</p>

      <p>I think about this a lot in my current work at the Federal Reserve, where I analyze bank mergers and financial stability. The structural questions I deal with every day &mdash; how banking markets concentrate, who gets served, what happens when a critical node fails &mdash; are the same questions the technology ecosystem was forced to confront during SVB's collapse, largely for the first time.</p>

      <p>The technology industry is remarkably sophisticated about many things. It is not sophisticated about how its own financial infrastructure connects to the broader economy. The people in the room during SVB's rapid ascent &mdash; the VCs, the growth-stage CFOs, the tech journalists &mdash; were not thinking about concentration risk, interest rate exposure, or the agricultural businesses that happened to share their bank. These are the kinds of things that regulators and policy economists think about professionally. But they weren't part of the conversation.</p>

      <p>This pattern extends well beyond banking. The technology sector is reshaping agriculture, energy, transportation, and healthcare, often without meaningful input from the people who understand how those industries are regulated, how their markets are structured, or whose livelihoods depend on them. The assumption seems to be that regulatory and policy expertise is something to manage &mdash; a compliance problem to solve after the product ships &mdash; rather than a perspective that should inform how the product is designed in the first place.</p>

      <p>I don't think the answer is for technologists to become policy experts, or for regulators to learn to code. The answer is that both need to be in the same room, and both need to take the other's knowledge seriously. The SVB failure was a case study in what happens when that doesn't occur. A bank that served both the most dynamic sector in the American economy and some of its most vulnerable agricultural communities was allowed to accumulate risk that any competent banking regulator would have flagged &mdash; but that risk was invisible to the people closest to it, because they didn't have the framework to see it.</p>

      <p>The next version of this failure &mdash; whether it manifests in agricultural finance, climate technology, or AI infrastructure &mdash; doesn't have to play out the same way. But preventing it requires building genuine bridges between the technology ecosystem and the policy world. Not adversarial ones. Collaborative ones.</p>

      <p>That's the room I want to be in.</p>
